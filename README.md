Medimate - Automatic Pill Dispenser
Overview
Medimate is an IoT-based automatic pill dispenser designed to help individuals take their medications on time. The system integrates an ESP32 microcontroller with a servo motor and a circular disc mechanism to dispense pills at scheduled times. A web-based HTTPS interface allows users to set and manage their medication schedules.

Features
Automated Pill Dispensing: Ensures timely medication by dispensing pills at preset times.
ESP32 Integration: Uses an ESP32 microcontroller for wireless connectivity and control.
Web-Based Scheduling: Users can configure pill schedules via a secure web interface.
Reminder System: Alerts users when it's time to take their medication.
User-Friendly Design: Simple and efficient mechanism for easy pill loading and dispensing.
Hardware Components
ESP32 Microcontroller - Handles scheduling and motor control.
Servo Motor - Rotates the dispensing disc to release pills.
Circular Disc Mechanism - Organizes and dispenses pills based on schedule.
Power Supply Module - Provides stable power to the system.
Software & Technologies
Microcontroller Programming: ESP32 (Arduino/C++)
Web Server: Flask (Python)
Database: Firebase / Google Sheets API (for storing schedules)
Cloud Integration: HTTPS for secure scheduling access
How It Works
User Setup: The user inputs their medication schedule via the web interface.
Schedule Storage: The schedule is stored in the cloud (Firebase/Google Sheets API).
Real-Time Execution: The ESP32 fetches the schedule and triggers the servo motor at the right time.
Pill Dispensing: The motor rotates the disc to release the correct pills.
User Notification: The system notifies the user when a pill is dispensed.
Installation & Usage
Hardware Setup: Assemble the ESP32, servo motor, and disc mechanism.
Firmware Upload: Flash the ESP32 with the provided Arduino code.
Server Setup: Deploy the Flask server and connect it to Firebase/Google Sheets.
User Access: Use the web interface to configure medication schedules.
Start Dispensing: The system will automatically dispense pills at the scheduled times.
Future Enhancements
Mobile App Integration for better accessibility.
Voice Assistance for reminders and user interaction.
Advanced Authentication to enhance security.
